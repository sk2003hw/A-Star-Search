# Amazon Coding Challenge for Bright Network Internship, June 2022

### Specification is at [this link](https://github.com/sk2003hw/A-Star-Search/blob/main/Amazon%20Coding%20Exercise%20-%20Pathfinding%20on%20a%202D%20Grid.pdf)
**This repository is for a path-finding algorithm on a 2-D grid for Amazon's self-driving vehicles. A-Star Search algorithm has been used to solve this problem (Phase 1, Phase 2). For a better understanding of the files and for the sample output check out [this pdf](https://github.com/sk2003hw/A-Star-Search/blob/main/Amazon%20Coding%20Challenge%20Bright%20Network%20Internship.pdf) or [this presentation](https://github.com/sk2003hw/A-Star-Search/blob/main/Amazon%20Coding%20Challenge%20Bright%20Network%20Internship.pptx). Connections between squares have been hardcoded but those to obstacles have been omitted. The code can be modified slightly to accomodate squares of different costs.**
